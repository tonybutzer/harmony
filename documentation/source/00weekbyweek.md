## Week by Week Class Summaries

## WEEK ONE
1. Project Kickoff and refinement of goals
	- Is this anything? - trial and error
	- `PRIOR Experience`
		- linux
		- docker
		- AWS
		- python
		- jupyter
	- `I want to build a notebook that radar charts the students`
	- Class questionnaire - via email
	- Communication preference of each student
	- efficiency and boredom mitigation
		- perhaps split each 1 hour into - concepts and practice - allow folks to bail at 1/2 way point
		- perhaps - threads or channels
			- jupyter thread
			- linux thread
			- docker thread
			- devops thread
			- python thread
			- management leadership - steering committee thread for PANGEO - strategy

	- I want Neal to drive most of the agenda and deep dive talks - at least initially - people can opt out
		- for example I could write a chapter on costs in AWS
			-perhaps most would be interested - I know Neal is
1. Week ONE - DEC 1,2020 Introduction and Basic Cloud Tour 
	- Quick overview of this document
		- added a glossary
		- please skim
		- if you have comments or questions - please use Teams/Chat to contact me
			- I will likely post some of the converstaions in this document
	- Neal's team won a free mini-pangeo
		- terraform 
		- the littleist jupyter hub - intro
	- Neal wanted a kanban too/also
	- SEE DEVOPS WEEKLY
		- [DEVOPS LINK](http://10.12.69.216/27etops.html?highlight=devops)

## Teams Note
Hey Class: - the course website is starting to take shape and is here:
- http://10.12.69.216/
	
we will fill in more color/detail as we go through our CASE Studies.
- our companion github repo is here - can't live in the cloud without github/dockerhub.
	- https://github.com/tonybutzer/harmony

---
- this is also where our cache of notebooks will live - like this one:
	- https://github.com/tonybutzer/harmony/blob/main/class/06-Instructor/01-Students.ipynb
	- https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tonybutzer/harmony/blob/main/class/06-Instructor/01-Students.ipynb
---
	- See you all on tuesday December 1st at 12 NOON

1. WEEK TWO - Lab & Random Cloud Questions
2. WEEK THREE - Delaware River Basin AOI
	- How to display AOI in Jupyter
		- geojson and shapefile
		- folium
2. LAB
3. Organizing our DATA Inputs in the Cloud
	- Fundamentals of S3
	- S3 is an object store
		- mostly not a big deal - but sometimes ...
	- Data Wrangling
	- Slow Data Transfers
		- ssh and scp
	- VPN do's and dont's 
3. LAB

## Project Initiation, Kickoff, and Approach

- Jump in with both feet approach.
- Gabriel Senay, Steffi Kagone - trail blazers
- Neal Pastick as trail blazer
- Continuous Training - Train The trainer
    - Example Steffi and Gabe Parish now writing visualizations directly

## Cloud Immersion Concept

### Use the cloud for EVERYTHING
- website
- kanban
- jupyter hub  - mini-pangeos
- all your data storage
    - move from clunky Netapps and archaic windows storage architectures
- leverage others work
- collaborate like hell

## Why

### For selfish reasons

- Impress your friends
- looks nice on the resume
- its more fun
- you don't have to deal with people you don't like

### Headlines

- Netflix Delivers Billions of Hours of Content Globally by Running on AWS 
- Steffi Kagone does 150 days of work in just THREE!

### Procurement delays not applicable

### Scalability

### USGS/DOI Efficiencies
- Remember DCOI threats
- Remember Cloud First
- Used to be mandates as a top down push
- Now science customer pull
- cost efficiencies
- It is irresponsible not to use the cloud

### Open Source Advantages
- numerous articles on why open source

### Python Momentum

### My favorite - less data wrangling - MORE SCIENCE
