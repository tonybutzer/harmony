# Vision

- Make Science Easy and Fun.

- Demonstrate PANGEO Architecture via practical science case studies

- Document AWS open source python tools for science

## Other Titles

- Harmony - for lots of reasons
- "Deep Dive into PANGEO"
- "Day in the Life of a New Cloud Science Project"
- " ET Case Study"
- "permaFrost case study"

## Computers and Website

A compute/computer/ec2/instance in the cloud is the same as a computer in EROS's CR2!
- let me say that again
	- A computer in the cloud is the **SAME** as a computer in EROS's CR2!
	- linux is linux wherever it swims
